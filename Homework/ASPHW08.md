#### ASP.NET Core MVC 2


1. What is the purpose of the Startup class in an MVC application?
- The Startup class is responsible for configuring the ASP.NET Core application

2. What is the purpose of the ConfigureServices() method?
- The ConfigureServices method is used to set up shared objects that can be used throughout the application through the dependency injection feature

3. What is the purpose of hte AddMvc() method?
- It sets up the shared objects used in MVC applications.

4. What does the book describe as "the heart of an MVC application?" Why do you think that this
"heart" is the starting point of all applications?
- The domain model. This is where the MVC defines all classes it uses to model real life objects and functionalities.


5. What is the purpose of the Queryable<T> interface? What does it allow you to do?
It allows a caller to obtain a sequence of Product objects. Only the product needed is queried versus querying all the products.
The IQueryable<T> interface allows a collection of objects to be queried efficiently.

6. How does the book describe loosely coupled components? Why is this an important principle of software design?
- It means that components consume functionality defined by interfaces without having any first-hand knowledge of which implementation classes are being used.

7. What, speciffically, does the AddTransient() method do?
- The AddTransient method specifies that a new FakeProductRepository object should be created each time the IProductRepository interface is needed.

8. Describe dependency injection? What is the dependency? What does it mean to say that it is injected?
- Dependency Injection is a design pattern that helps a class separate the logic of creating dependent objects.
- Dependency Injection is a way to implement IoC such that the dependencies are "injected" into a class from some external source.
- The injected dependencies can either be received as constructor parameters of a class or can be assigned to properties of that class designed for that purpose.

9. What is the purpose of a shared layout?
- It is to ensure that views are consistent and to provide a single entry point to modify the views of all the pages of the website.

10. What is a database context class? What purpose does it serve?
- The database context class is the bridge between the application and Entity Framework Core and provides access to the applicationâ€™s data using model objects.

11. What function does the EnsurePopulated() method perform?
- It ensure that the Identity database is seeded every time that an AccountController object is created to handle an HTTP request.

12. What is a ViewModel? How does a ViewModel differ from an ordinary model?
- IT is a view which is used specifically to pass data between a controller and a view(Only rendering the view). An ordinary model can pass/retrieve data to either a view or a controller.

13. Describe in your own words a composable URL. Note that it is not an answer to this question to say that it is one that makes sense to a user.
- A composable URL is one that gets page information dynamically and makes the url syntax easier to read.

14. What is a partial view? Illustrate the concept of a partial view with an example other than the one used in the book.
- Partial views are a special type of views that are rendered inside other views. They are useful for reusing parts of a view or splitting a large view into smaller components.
