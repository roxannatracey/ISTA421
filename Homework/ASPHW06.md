1. What is the primary idea that underlies Dependency Injection?

2. Describe the role of interfaces in implementing a dependency injection
container.

3. List the three stages of building basic Ninject functionality, and brieﬂy
deﬁne each stage.

1- Prepare Ninject for use - create an instance of a Ninject kernel
2- Configure
the kernel - make Ninject understand which implementation objects you want to
use for each interface
3- Create an object``

4. What is the purpose of a custom dependency resolver?
- Ensures the MVC Framework uses Ninject whenever it creates an object.

5. What is the purpose of conditional binding? Describe how it works.
- The bindings specify what class Ninject should use as implementation of an
interface when creating a particular object.

6. Why is setting the object scope important when using dependency injection?
- Lets you control the lifecycle of the objects you create.

7. Brieﬂy describe the Test Driven Development approach in developing an
application.
- TDD is a development approach where a test is written first, then the code is
written to fulfill the test, followed by refactoring.

8. Consider the Assert class. How do you access the methods of that class?
- using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

9. Why is it useful to mock objects when developing software?
- Because they simulate the functionality of real objects from your project in
a specific and controlled way.

10. Brieﬂy describe the two main issues that arise when attempting to do Unit
Tests without the aid of some sort of mocking library.
- The tests will fail if the discount logic in the implementation changes. If
the test fails, you won't know where the problem is.
